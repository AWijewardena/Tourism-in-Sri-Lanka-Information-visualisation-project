  <h1>About The Visualization</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Information Visualizations!</p>
  <p>This page is dedicated to provide the users an understanding of the visualization project & the data sources used.</p>
  <p><H3>Introduction</h3></p>
  <p>The visualization created represents the statistics of tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka throughout the years of 2018 to 2023.
  Since 2023 is not yet complete, the data relating to that specific year is available until the month of April. 
  Tourism is considered as one of the main incomes in Sri Lanka. Since 1977 tourism has contributed to a vast growth of the country’s 
  financial status. While this industry is considered to be the most lucrative within Sri Lanka, recent years have shown a major drop 
  in tourist arrivals. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, travelling was limited, which meant the main income of the country was suddenly 
  halted. As the pandemic grew, the island’s economy started to be negatively affected. More recently due to the low funds and the 
  rapidly growing inflation rates, the value of the Sri Lankan currency the rupee has been decreased immensely, leading the country to
  an economic crisis. The highest number of tourists that visit Sri Lanka are from United Kingdom, Russian federation, Germany and 
  India. Therefore, the visualization is centered around the statistics of the mentioned countries. This visualization, shows the 
  difference of tourist arrivals between these critically impacted years.</p>
